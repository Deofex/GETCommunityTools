                A ticket is going through different states. It’s created, unblocked, sold to an end user, maybe it’s resold to someone else, it’s scanned at the event etc. Each of those actions, called statechanges, are registered and is made public. This page is displaying the amount of statechanges which are registered. It shows the usage of <b class=getcolor>GET</b> and can help you to determine how much <b class=getcolor>GET</b> will be bought back from the market.</p>
